# C-Sharp-Projects
This repo holds all the examples learned during the C# and .NET framework course.
I learned how to use the C# programming language in conjunction with the .NET Framework in order to build the back-end of web applications.

## Console App Array
- Created a console app that does/contains the following:

- A one-dimensional Array of strings. Asks the user to select an index of the Array and then display the string at that index on the screen.

- Added in a message that displays when the user selects an index that doesnâ€™t exist.

- Created a list of strings. Ask the user to select an index of the list and then display the content at that index on the screen.
